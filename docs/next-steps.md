At this point, we've covered a basic use case for most of the components that are provided by `navigation-components`, but there's still quite a bit we haven't touched on yet.

In the following sections, we'll cover more specific use cases and configurations that you might come across while developing. These guides will assume that you've read or are familiar with the concepts presented in the first few sections. Topics that we will cover include:

- navigating to anywhere, from anywhere, in your app
- building a basic multipage login form
- setting up and running unit and integration tests with `navigation-test-utils`
- setting up deep links and developing with deep links
- configuring and controlling transitions for individual screens and containers
- more advanced routing examples: relative paths, queries, and params
- useFocus() and useOnFocus() hooks for data fetching, tabs
- end to end testing with `detox`
- using native stack navigators

Let's get started!
