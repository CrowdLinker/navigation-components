At this point, we've covered a basic use case for pretty much every component that is provided by `navigation-components`. While we've covered a lot of ground already, there's still quite a bit we haven't touched on yet.

In the following sections, we'll cover more specific use cases and configurations that you might come across while developing. These guides will assume that you've read or are familiar with the concepts presented in the first few sections. Topics that we will cover include:

- more advanced routing examples: relative paths, queries, and params
- navigating to anywhere, from anywhere, in your app
- setting up deep links and developing with deep links
- using native stack navigators
- configuring and controlling transitions for any and all screens
- useFocus() and useOnFocus()
- building a basic multipage login form
- setting up and running unit and integration tests with `navigation-test-utils`
- end to end testing with `detox`

Let's get started!
